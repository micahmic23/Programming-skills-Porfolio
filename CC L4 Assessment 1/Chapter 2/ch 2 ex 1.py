#Exercise 1: Variables
#Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new message.

msg = "I really enjoy spending time with you" #The variable msg holds the quoted message and prints it as output
print(msg)

msg = "Thank you, I do too" #The same variable assigns a new message and prints it
print(msg)
