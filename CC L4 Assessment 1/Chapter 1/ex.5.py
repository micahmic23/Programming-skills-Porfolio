#Exercise 5: Compute area of Circle 
#Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
                   
from math import pi #The value of pi is imported to the program to be used in the area of the circle
r=float(input("Input radius of a circle")) # The variable r is used to store input (radius of circle)
print("The area of the circle with radius" , str(r) , "is:" , str(pi*r**2))#The area is then calculated and printed as output
